AGENT

A cross-university multi-discipline team. Members came from Dept. Engineering Science & Dept. of Zoology, Oxford, Microsoft Research, Cambridge and Dept. of Zoology University of Sheffield.

GOAL

Prediction of Homing Pigeon flight trajectories.

DATA

Recorded flight GPS data was used train the model. 31 birds, each with over 20 test flights from different test sites.

METHODS

Used the Gaussian procces Machine learning Model. Took each flight and using equations outlined in the paper, predicted its immediate successor. This was then compared against a prior computed flight path probabilty which gave it a score (Marginal Information Gain). Model was then retrained.

RESULTS

As number of flights increased, M.I.G increased drastically. After 20 flights, future flight paths were extremely predictable.

COMMENTS

Further application for this would be to apply to other animal movement paths. Eg. locating food sources in the ocean by tracking seagulls.
