GOAL

Generate depth facial modeling from video capture.

DATA

Videos from nine different camera.

METHODS

CNNs, data augmentation and GPU acceleration.

RESULTS

Compare to other traditionnal method (Thies, Cao), the recognition of facial expression is way more performant. The Nvidia system can reproduce more complex facial expression.
