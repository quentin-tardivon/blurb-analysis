AGENT
A team out of University College London lead by Dr Parashkev Nachev.

GOAL
To improve our ability to determine whether a new drug works in the brain of a human.

DATA
The team looked at large scale data from patients who had suffered strokes and created the largest collection of 
anatomically registered images of strokes ever assembled.

METHODS
They simulated a large-scale meta-analysis of a set of hypothetical drugs, to see if treatment effects of different 
magnitudes that would have been missed by conventional statistical analysis could be identified with machine learning. 
No algorithm given.

RESULTS
Results of note were in relation to drugs that are used to shrink lesions on the brain. Conventional low-dimension 
models required the lesion to shrink by 78.4% of its volume for the effect to be detected in trials more often than not. 
With the high-dimensional modelling of their approach this threshold was reduced to 55%.
