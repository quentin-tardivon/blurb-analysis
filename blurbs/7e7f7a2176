AGENT 
A team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and Harvard University.

GOAL 
A machine learning algorithm trained to understand neural representations of suicidal behaviour.

DATA 
17 patients with suicidal ideation and 17 others that were to serve as a control.

METHODS 
Patient's brains were monitored, using a MRI machine, while being presented with 6 key words: "death, cruelty, trouble, carefree, good, praise".

RESULTS 
Correctly identified 15 out of the 17 patients with suicidal ideation and 16 out of the 17 control for an overall accuracy of 91 percent.

COMMENTS 
While the results of these tests are high, it would be difficult to implement, in a practical sense, as it requires the use of an MRI machine.
