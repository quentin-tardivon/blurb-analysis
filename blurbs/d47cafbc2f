DATA

Numerous eye tracking data gathered from many subjects in a span of years.

METHODS

Algorithms relating to computer vision methodologies, perceptrons, neural networks.

RESULTS

There have been promising results in this matter. Dr. Komogortsev has made a breakthrough with his research, although there are more to be done to improve biometric security.

COMMENTS

It may be possible to forge biometric signatures, perhaps it is already possible now. Eye tracking has been important for security since this is the future of technology.
