GOAL

To enable face detection technologies to recognise faces even if the subject wears a disguise.

DATA

Two face disguise datasets with 2000 images each. The databases are composed of images of 25 subjects ranging in age from 18 to 30 and with a variety of backgrounds (simple and complex), and 10 different  disguises.  

METHODS

14 key points on the face are used to create star-net structures to classify images. Pictures of the disguised face is then compared against a group of 5 individuals without disguises, including the disguised subject, and the similarity of a disguised face is estimated against the non-disguised face by computing an L1 norm between the orientation of different key points obtained using the net-structure

RESULTS

The frame-work is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art methods on key-point detection and face disguise classification

COMMENTS

Will be useful for law enforcement and intelligence communities.
