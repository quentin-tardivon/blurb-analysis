AGENT
Tomas Pfister   James Charles Andrew Zisserman 
GOAL
human pose estimation in videos, where multiple frames are available
 DATA
BBC Pose dataset,Extended BBC Pose dataset, ChaLearn dataset and Poses in the Wild (PiW) and FLIC datasets.

METHODS
Compares the estimated joints against frames with manual ground truth

RESULTS
Created a new architecture for pose estimation in video which could be expanded further to things such as classification and segmentation
COMMENTS
Another bedrock project which will be used further to improve neural networks ability to render 3d scenes and allow future CNN's in the to produce better 3d rendering.
