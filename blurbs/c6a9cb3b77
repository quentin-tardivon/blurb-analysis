GOAL
The goal of this algorithm is to detect malaria parasites in blood samples
DATA
The machine learning algorithm was given healthy and unhealthy blood samples.
METHODS 
The machine learning algorithm analysed the blood smears and look for malaria parasite.  
RESULTS
 The project was very successful and it is able to detect the malaria parasite in under 20 minutes.
It also decreased the cost and removed a bottle neck in analysing a blood sample as a human doctor, who are in short supply, are no longer needed.
COMMENTS
 There is no description of the algorithm that they used but I believe that it was probably based off a difference from a "normal" blood sample
