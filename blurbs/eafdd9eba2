AGENT

Dileep George, cofounder of Vicarious

GOAL

To mimic human vision and solve CAPTCHAs, i.e. pass the turing test

DATA

Previously, millions of labeled CAPTCHA images were used as a training set.
Vicarious' system required much less training data. Specifically 300 times less


METHODS

State-of-the-art deep-learning neural nets were used

RESULTS

CAPTCHAs are said to be useless if an algorithm can solve it at least 1% of the time.
Vicarious' solution had an accuracy rate of 66.6 percent.
