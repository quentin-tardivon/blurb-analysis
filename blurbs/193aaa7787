University College London

GOAL

Wanted to determine whether machine learning could improve the ability to determine whether new drugs have affects on the brain

DATA

Large scale data set from stroke patients, including anatomical patterns of brain damage

METHODS

Used gaze direction as indication of stroke impact and simulated meta-analysis of hypothetical drugs

RESULTS

The researchers discovered that machine learning based models may allow better analysis of new drugs for the brain compared to statistical models
