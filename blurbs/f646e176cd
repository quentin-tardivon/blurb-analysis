AGENT
This project was undertaken by Google’s DeepMind.

GOAL
The goal is to use machine learning to help fight against blindness.

DATA
There is no current data available now but the number of people with sight loss is set to double by 2050, with around two million people in the UK currently living with sight loss. But DeepMind believe that by with the help of machine learning around 98 per cent of sight loss can be prevented.

METHODS
There are no initial methods now, but DeepMind and the NHS do plan on applying the machine learning process across a million eyes scans to help search for early symptoms of sight loss. 

RESULTS
As there is no current data or methods, there is also no initial results.
There are expected results which are by detecting eye diseases as early as possible gives patients the best possible chance of getting the correct treatments and maintaining their sight.

COMMENTS
I think the use of machine learning in eye treatment research is a great idea as to many people their eyes are the most important things to them and to lose them can be life changing. The idea of being able to save your sight would appeal to a lot of people.
