AGENT

The DeepInstinct team (Dr. Eli David et al.)

GOAL

Improve cybersecurity using deep learning techniques.

DATA

Large amounts of malicious/benign files.

METHODS

"Proprietary deep learning technology", or, in the common tongue, "we're not
telling you, but it's *even cooler* than regular machine learning."

RESULTS

They claim the system can defeat 99% of cyberattacks, but it's not clear where
that number comes from.

COMMENTS

Since this is all proprietary, not an enormous amount of tangible information
was provided, unfortunately.
