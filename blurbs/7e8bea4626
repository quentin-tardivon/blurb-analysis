AGENT
Bit Defender, a company that invests some 25 percent of its yearly budget in researching and developing ambitious security project.

GOALS
Revolutionary ideas that grow into breakthrough technologies are what characterize Bitdefender, a company that invests some 25 percent of its yearly budget in researching and developing ambitious security projects. Bitdefender doesn't fully rely on machine learning technology for detection, instead opting for a layered approach. Machine learning is an indispensable part of our technology security stack, not only by proactively and accurately identifying new and unknown threats, but also by augmenting the detection capabilities of those security technologies.

DATA
Bitdefender has a portfolio of 72 patents in areas such as machine learning, anti-spam, anti-phishing, anti-fraud, antimalware, virtualization, BOX-functionality and hardware design, including 42 delivered in the past three years, and 35 under examination. Ten percent of the patents apply to machine learning in malware detection and online threats, deep learning and anomaly-based detection techniques, strengthening Bitdefender's thought leadership positioning globally.

METHODS
Since 2009, the development and training of machine learning algorithms has been a key focus for Bitdefender Laboratories, proving extremely effective in detecting threats in a sophisticated, modern threat landscape.

RESULTS
The experience of working with machine learning algorithms to detect new and unknown malware samples has substantially improved detection rates and reduced false positives. For Bitdefender, machine learning has proven the best method in data analysis, polymorphic and generic malware detection, among others.

COMMENTS
For Bitdefender, Machine Learning has really paved a way for it to offer the best possible protection to its users.
