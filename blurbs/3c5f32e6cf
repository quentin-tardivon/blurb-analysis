GOAL

Modeling disease progression based on real-world evidence is a very challenging task due to the incompleteness and irregularity of the observations, as well as the heterogeneity of the patient conditions.

DATA

Patient records (that were diagnosed with COPD)

METHODS

Expectation Maximization (EM) based algorithm.

RESULTS

They trained the model using the exact same settings but without the anchors. As a result, conditions from different comorbidities were mixed into one.

COMMENTS

The techniques presented in this paper open the door to many new applications of disease progression modeling.
