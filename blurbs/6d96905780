GOAL 

Provide more efficient and accurate customer recomendations

DATA 

Customer history: Viewed, rated and purchased items.

METHODS 

Clustering of the customers. The customers are grouped by splitting them into clusters and assign the active customer to a specific cluster. This is done by assigning a vector to each customer. The vector contains data about each item and wether or not the user has interacted with it. The value is positive if the user bought or rated the item, negative if the user disliked the item or zero if the user has not interacted with the item. The clusters were then generated by initially having a random number of empty clusters and assign randomly selected customers to each. Then customers were assigned to clusters based on similarity. Sub algorithms ran during this time to split and merge clusters as they built up.

RESULTS 

This provided a much more efficient way to quickly generate recomendations for users

COMMENTS 

Here the quality of the recomendations can be low as the purchases and ratings are averaged out in each cluster. Each customer is grouped with a large number of customers which means customers with more unique tastes will often get useless recomendations.
