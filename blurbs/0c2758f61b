AGENT 

Tesla

GOAL 

Self driving cars capable of out performing human pilots and reducing accidents on the road.

DATA 

Thousands of hours of driving footage, from dash-cams to traffic cameras.

METHODS  

The algorithms use visual techniques to break down the videos and to understand them. The goal is that when something unexpected happens - a ball rolls into the street - the car can recognize the pattern and react accordingly.

RESULTS 

Hopefully a self driving smart car capable of avoiding collisions.

COMMENTS 

Self driving cars are still in the early stages of development however tests are showing positive signs.
