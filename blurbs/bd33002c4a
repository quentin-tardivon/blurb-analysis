GOAL

To enable the detection of liver masses or tumours on livers.

DATA

100 liver mass image sets from CT scans in 2016, including 74 men and 26 women with the average age of 66 years old

METHODS

The article declares the use convolution neural networks were trained on CT scans to be able to detect tumours. 

RESULTS

The article states that the model generated was successful at detecting liver masses without declaring success rate or accurate assessment.

COMMENTS

Despite not declaring the accuracy of the method in the article. A link to the study which states median accuracy for differential diagnosis of liver masses of 0.84.
