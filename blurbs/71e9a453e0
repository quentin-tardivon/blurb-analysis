GOAL
To introduce the Gaussian processes for time-series data analysis and the conceptual framework of Bayesian modelling in this filed. 

DATA
 dataset D = {(x1, y1),(x2, y2)} consist- functions that agree
ing of two observations

METHODS
GPs - Gaussian processes provide a principal practical aproach to learning in karnel machines.Training the GP model involves both model selection, or the discrete choice between
different functional forms for mean and covariance functions as well as adaptation
of the hyperparameters of these function.
n the Bayesian approach, all unknown quantities are considered as random variables and uncertainties over those quantities are represented using probability distributions conditional on the available data 

RESULTS
Gaussian processes advantages with respect to the interpretation of model predictions and provides a wellfoundedframework for learning and model selection. Theoretical and practical
developments of over the last decade have made Gaussian processes a serious competitor for real supervised learning applications.
