AGENT
Carl Vondrick
GOAL
They are showing a little passage from a video and trying to make the machine predict what happens next.
DATA
The team trained the algorithm with 2 million videos from Flickr.These videos were unlabelled.
METHOD
Adversarial Networks were used for this. One of them was generating the videos and the other one was trying to judge whether if it is fake or not.
RESULTS
The results are still blurry. Since they are still developing it.For now,according to Vondrick his program is still like a 10 years old child.
COMMENTS
I have to admit, it sounds pretty exiciting to think the program as a child. Every development and every experience it gets, it is actually kind of growing like a child.
