AGENT

A team of computer scientists at the University of Chicago

GOAL

a machine learning system that learns to spot risk factors for unprofessional conduct. The department can then step in before risk transforms into actual harm.

DATA

The system was tested among Charlotte-Mecklenberg officers in their day to day duty.

METHODS

The system being tested in Charlotte is designed to include all of the records a department holds on an individual – from details of previous misconduct and gun use to their deployment history, such as how many suicide or domestic violence calls they have responded to.

The idea is to prevent incidents in which officers who are stressed behave aggressively.

RESULTS

It retrospectively caught 48 out of 83 adverse incidents between 2005 and now – 12 per cent more than Charlotte-Mecklenberg’s existing early intervention system. More importantly, the false positive rate – the fraction of officers flagged as being under stress who do not go on to act aggressively – was 32 per cent lower than the existing system’s.

COMMENTS

With the controversy among police departments in the US recently, important work needs to be done to diminish the amount of wrong doing that occurs. Important research
