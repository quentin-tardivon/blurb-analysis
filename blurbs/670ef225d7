GOAL

To introduce machine learning into the academic world, allowing a tailored approach for individual students and identifying possible improvements in curricula. 

DATA

Extensive data for each student including assignment submissions, grades, course selection etc and data about each course's curriculum, grading methods and teaching materials. 

METHODS

This data can be used for many purposes. One such purpose is identifying historical trends in fail grades in certain courses. The performance of different lecturers teaching the same course could be analysed to identify lecturers who result in high failure rates. Student performance can be analysed on a personal basis in order to provide recommendations on areas in which the student or perhaps even the class as a whole, is struggling. Timetabling issues could also be resolved by employing machine learning to make scheduling decisions and monitor the student quota to room size ratios. 

RESULTS 

An education system with higher student retention, a more personalised student experience and a sophisticated way of identifying teaching staff who are underperforming in their role.

COMMENTS

This seems like an excellent way to overhaul the university system, which has become more concerned with money than performance.
