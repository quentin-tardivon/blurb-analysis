GOAL 
To use Xray images to automatically detect if a patient has pneumonia
DATA 
ChestX-ray14(the largest public database of X-rays): they used a series of chest X-rays some with and some without pneumonia
METHODS 
CheXNet, is a 121-layer convolutional neural network that inputs a chest X-ray image and outputs the probability of pneumonia along with a heatmap localizing the areas of the image most indicative of pneumonia
RESULTS 
can detect pneumonia better than most radiologists
