GOAL
 
To provide a voice for Siri that is both pleasant and intelligible, which covers all possible utterances that siri may speak.

DATA 

Between ten to twenty hours of speech patterns. These patterns can range from readings from a novel to jokes from a joke book. 

METHODS 

These ten to twenty hours of speech is not enough to cover all possible speech patterns siri may need, thus apple slices the recorded speech into units. Apple then uses a deep mixture density network to model both the means and variances of the speech features which is used for guiding unit selection sythesis.

RESULTS

A deep MDN-based hybrid unitselection text to speech system for siri.
