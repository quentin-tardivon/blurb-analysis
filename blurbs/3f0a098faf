AGENT - Douglas Aberdeen ,Ondrej Pacovsky, Andrew Slater
GOAL -  The Priority Inbox attempts to alleviate such information overload by learning a per-user statistical model of importance, and ranking mail by how likely the user is to act on that mail
DATA - how the user interacts with a mail after delivery
METHODS - Linear logistic regression -  the final prediction is the sum of the global model and the user model log odds. Mails are classified in to two categories they are important and not important. Opening a mail is a strong signal of importance here.
RESULTS - The success rate was around 80-85%
COMMENTS - Since this technique is based on wheather the user open a mail or not, many user tend to open not so important mails, which led decrease in success rate
