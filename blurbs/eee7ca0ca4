GOAL
Using deep max-pooling convolutional neural networks to detect mitosis in breast histology images using the pixels in the image to create a patch centered on the pixel
 DATA
The public MITOS dataset including 50 images corresponding to 50 high-power fields in 5 different biopsy slides stained with Hematosin & Eosin
 
METHODS
Given an input RGB image I, it tries to find a set D = {d1, d2, . . . , dN } of detections, each reporting the centroid coordinates for a single mitosis. After training the program. Each pixel is assigned one of two possible classes, mitosis or non-mitosis, the former to pixels at (or close to) mitosis centroids, the latter to all other pixels. 

RESULTS
 
Their approach yields an F-score of 0.782, significantly higher than the F-score obtained by the closest competitor (0.718)
Also won the ICPR 2012 mitosis detection competition, outperforming other contestants by a significant margin
 
COMMENTS
 
Sample size was only 50 images, although there are multiple mitosis event in each image it is still relatively small compared to other machine learning applications.
