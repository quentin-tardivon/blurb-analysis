AGENT
This project taken on by Google researchers.

GOAL
To goal was to design and create an AI Ophthalmologist to recognize a common form of eye disease as well as many experts can.

DATA
The algorithm used can look at retinal images and detect diabetic retinopathy as well as a trained ophthalmologist can. The researchers created a training set of 128,000 retinal images classified by at least three ophthalmologists.

METHODS
Using the deep learning technique, the researchers developed an algorithm to analyse retinal images. Once the algorithm was trained, using the training set of 128,000 retinal images, the researchers tested its performance on 12,000 images and found that it matched or exceeded the performance of experts in identifying the condition and grading its severity.

RESULTS
In result, the researchers collaborated with scientists in India, where a clinical trial involving real patients is ongoing. This project involves patients receiving a normal consultation, but their images are also fed into the deep-learning system for comparison. According to Google, results from this trial are not yet ready for publication.

COMMENTS
In my opinion, I believe the use of machine learning in medicine is a great idea, especially for certain areas of the world where the lack of expertise is noticeable.
