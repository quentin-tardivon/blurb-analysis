AGENT

AI company Vicarious.

GOAL

To develope a program that can solve CAPTCHAs meant to detect bots.

DATA

CAPTCHA datasets from Google, Yahoo, Paypal and data from BotDetect system. They also used the MNIST dataset with added occlusions and noise.

METHODS

They created a model called Recursive Cortical Network (RCN), which is an object-based model that assumes factorization of contours and surfaces, and objects and background.

RESULTS

The system was able to bypass BotDetect system with an accuracy of 57 percent with less training than conventional neural networks.

COMMENTS

CAPTCHAs are still ubiquitous online despite their diminishing effectiveness in bot detection.
