Three publicly traded Japanese publishers and a South Korean developer have signed up to use the product.
Declining to give their names because of confidentiality agreements.( possibly silicon studios as it is mentioned in the paper)

GOAL
The goal of this work is twofold: on the one hand, to
accurately forecast time series of in-game sales and playtime;
on the other, to simulate events in order to find the best
combination of in-game events and the optimal time to publish
them. 

DATA
Users gameplay data. such as but not limited to: 
Amount of time played
What times of day played
Game progress
Skill level
Ages 
Sexes

METHODS
To achieve the above goals, 
we performed an experimental
analysis utilizing several techniques such as ARIMA (dynamic
regression), gradient boosting, generalized additive models and deep neural networks G. E. Box and G. M. Jenkins, Time series analysis: forecasting and

supervised time series forecast.

RESULTS
The results suggest that, even though the performance
of traditional approaches such as ARIMA is still better, the
outcomes of state-of-the-art techniques like deep learning are
promising. Deep learning comes up as a well-suited general model
that could be used to forecast a variety of time series with
different dynamic behaviors.
