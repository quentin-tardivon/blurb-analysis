AGENT
A team at the University of Washington

GOAL
To create a system that could quantify the power and agency of characters in movies based on their dialogue and stage 
directions.

DATA
The scripts of nearly 800 movies.

METHODS
Built on a previous project involving "connotation frames" but doesn't mention algorithms employed. Algorithms cross 
referenced words with a bank of 2000 commonly used words whos connotations were scored on both their power and agency.

RESULTS
Found gender bias in the writing of many characters. For example in "Black Swan" the female leads dialogue gives her more 
agency but in the stage directions more power and agency was given to male characters.
