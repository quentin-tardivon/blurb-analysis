Yelp
GOAL
Use deep learning to classify business photos
DATA
Photos uploaded by people that use Yelp
METHODS
Yelp focused initially on only sorting photos into a handful of predefined classes. Once they had the labeled data, they employed deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the form of ”AlexNet” to recognize those classes.
RESULTS
On an evenly split gold test set of 2,500 photos, our current classifier shown above has an overall precision of 94% of precision and recall of 70%.
