GOAL

To solve difficult problems with the use of "Quantum machine learning".

DATA

N/A

METHODS

Quantum computers are used which uses machine learning to solve problems. The data is prepared with a method called "quantum state preperation" followed by deciding on a language to use. The last step involves a step called "measurement" is used to be able to read the results

RESULTS

Various results including one from Switzerland, specifically. It took a few days for a computer with "100 to 200 quantum bits" to output the result for difficult chemical reaction.

COMMENTS

I wonder wether the kinds of problems could be extended to the likes of P vs. NP, or even hard mathematical problems? Applying AI and machine learning algorithms on a quantum computer is fascinating and could perhaps deal with questions in philosophy such as determinism etc.
