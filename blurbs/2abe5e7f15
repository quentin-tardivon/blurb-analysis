SOURCEBringing neural networks to cellphones. http://news.mit.edu/2017/bringing-neural-networks-cellphones-0718AGENTVivienne Sze, MIT Researcher.GOALTo evaluate new techniques for paring down neural networks so that they’ll run more efficiently on handheld devices.DATAData from electronic devices that simulate nueral network.METHODSAnalytic method that can determine how much power a neural network will consume when run on a particular type of hardware.RESULTSTeam was abe to increase a system's portability by evaluating the neural net’s power consumption.COMMENTSThis could result in reducing the sizes of portables and nueral based systems that may become popular in future.
