AGENT 

Giuseppe Ateniese and a team of researchers at Stevens.

GOAL

To probe and ethically hack networks and servers so that they can be improved.

DATA

Networks that use conventional security protocols - millions of these worldwide or locally.

METHODS

The team developed a neural network known as GAN - generative adversarial network, a set
of algorithms that improve the more times they repeat a task. They used GAN to guess
passwords.

RESULTS

GAN went beyond the successes of the best password guessing tools and managed to crack many
supposedly secure passwords. It was able to learn human tendencies and patterns in passwords
that we would not even know were there. 

COMMENTS

Because GAN was used in ethical hacking, it can be used to expose our predispositions to
certain password patterns, and so can help us to improve our password strengths.
However, in the wrong hands, GAN could wreak havoc in the data world as a lot of sensitive
and private data could be exposed due to weak passwords.
