GOAL

goal is to employ machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies to improve the healthcare delivery system; in particular, a key CCDS objective is to improve the effectiveness of imaging-based diagnosis.

DATA

One of the key resources for more general image recognition projects, for example, is the open source ImageNet database, with over 14 million labeled images. 

METHODS

The CCDS is pursuing a variety of machine learning approaches, but the primary technology that it is employing is deep neural networks (also known as deep learning). 

RESULTS

No results yet as this requires time but the objective is harnessing the power of deep learning for medical image analysis

COMMENTS

This is the capability to make the world a better place
