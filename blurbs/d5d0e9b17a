AGENT

Google/AlphaGo Zero

GOAL

To improve on the original AlphaGO program.

DATA

The data that the program was given was just the rules of the game.

METHODS

The program used a combination of two of the most powerful algorithms currently fuelling AI: deep learning and reinforcement learning. AlphaGo Zero never saw humans play. From a relatively modest five million games of self-play, taking only three days on a smaller computer than the original AlphaGo, it then learned super-AlphaGo performance. Its learning roughly mimicked some of the stages through which humans progress as they master Go. AlphaGo Zero rapidly learned to reject naively short-term goals and developed more strategic thinking, generating many of the patterns of moves often used by top-level human experts. But remarkably it then started rejecting some of these patterns in favour of new strategies never seen before in human play.

RESULTS

The AlphaGo Zero program made a huge improvement, AlphaGo Zero beat the original AlphaGo in a 100-game match by 100 to 0.

COMMENTS

It was very impressive that no humans were involved in the ALphaGo Zero training, it poses the question, will computers need humans at all in the future?
