GOAL

Create a system that can generate questions to test the users comprehension of a giving piece of text. 

DATA

NLP datasets such as 'SQuAD' and 'MS MARCO'

METHODS

Text is analysed on a sentence and sentence plus paragraph level. Given sentence-question pairs from the dataset the model tries to minimise the negative log likelihood of the training data with respect to all parameters

RESULTS

This question generation model outperforms previous models that used human entered rules for generation, but performs worse than questions directly created by humans.

COMMENTS

Could be a useful tool for study as it will ensure comprehension of the material, and even though it performed worse than a human it is still very useful as it can generate questions on a much larger scale than a human possibly could.
