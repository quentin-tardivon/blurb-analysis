Fan Long,  Martin Rinard

GOAL 
Creation of a automatic bug removal tool

DATA 
errornous code (bugs) faced by users of open source project and the solution to the bugs posted by them

METHODS 
recognizing various values stored in memory during runtime like variables and constants. They identified 30 prime characteristics of a given value and that evaluated all the possible relationships between these characteristics in successive lines of code. More than 3,500 such relationships constitute their feature set. Their machine-learning algorithm then tried to determine what combination of features most consistently predicted the success of a patch

RESULTS 
they were able to fix 10 times as many errors as its predecessors

COMMENTS 
this could help in the final stage of the lifecycle of a program where most of the time is spend during testing and debugging.
