AGENT

Stanford Machine Learning Group

GOAL

Diagnose diseases based on chest X-ray

DATA

hundreds of thousands of chest X-rays labeled with up to 14 possible pathologies

METHODS

Used a deep learning method trained on the labeled x-rays

RESULTS

At the end it could identify the diseases better than a radiologist in all 14 identification tasks

COMMENTS

The article did not explain the method very well would have liked a better explanation
