GOAL

How Machine learning is helping drive cloud adoption

DATA

No dtata mentioned

METHODS

The internet of things is big on connecting machines so that they can communicate with one another and exchange data. Machine learning helps to drive these types of interactions, and using the cloud makes it even easier for machines to exchange data with one another as there will be an easy way to make those connections.

RESULTS

Machine learning and cloud services make an excellent combination, as many cloud services make it easy to provision the resources needed for the collection, storage, and retrieval of large amounts of data. The biggest reasons this works is that such cloud services offer both flexibility and scalability.

COMMENTS

Since everything is on the cloud these days and people rely on it so much for storage and things, machine learning is going to be a big part in anything involved with the cloud.
