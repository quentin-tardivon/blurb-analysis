AGENT 

Researchers at New York Times labs.

GOAL

To use machine learning to reduce the tedious jobs that journalists must do when preparing
a news story.

DATA

Websites and articles used by journalists.

METHODS

The tool, known as Editor, uses tags to identify people, places, concepts, quotes, etc in 
a webpage or article so that the factchecking that a journalist must do can be done much 
faster and so the journalist's time can be better spent on other stories. The algorithm
can learn what story the journalist is researching and so can look more relevant data the
more it is used.

RESULTS

The algorithm is already making journalists jobs much easier, but it struggles with the
context of different words. For example, it struggles to identify the contextual difference 
of 'Washington' in Denzel Washington and The Washington Post.

COMMENTS

The tool is already working in that aspects of journalist's jobs are being being made less 
menial and so they can work on other news stories, thus improving the overall quality of
news. Once the tool can be taught contextual differences, it will become even better and
could have uses in academia and law as a tool for researching.
