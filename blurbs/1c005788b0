AGENT
This project was undertaken by Parag Mital.

GOAL
To implement a fast sampler for NSynth, a neural network audio synthesizer, to make it easier for anyone to generate their own sounds with the model.

DATA
Mital used sounds which he downloaded from freesound.org and then loaded and resampled these to the required sample rate of 16000.

METHODS
Mital used audio files which he then encoded and decoded. Once he created the encoding, he then generated(or decoded) it , similar to what an audio player does to an MP3 file. However, since NSynth is such a large model, generating audio can take a few minutes per sample. To solve this, he used deep learning to implement a faster sampler in NSynth. From this, he then explored generating resynthesized, timestretching and interpolation of different audio samples.

RESULTS
With the help of deep learning, Mital was able to implement a faster sampler in Nsynth, which is now part of Magentas official repo on Github.

COMMENTS
I think the idea of using neural networks which are capable of learning and directly generating raw audio samples, opens up a world of possibilities for music creaters, giving them many more options in their approach to sound design and making music.
