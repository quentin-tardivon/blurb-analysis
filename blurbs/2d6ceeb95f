AGENT

Computer Scientists from Google Brain, the centrak Google AI Team

GOAL

To add detail and enhance blurry / pixelated images

DATA

Millions of detailed images (of the same resolution) can be used 
as a training set, by artifically pixelating them

METHODS

The combination of a conditioning neural network and a prior neural network
analyzed the images. The conditioning network takes the low-res
image and compares it to the high-res images to determing whether
a face or a room is in the image

RESULTS

The AI succesfully added detail and de-blurred images with a small error

COMMENTS

This can be used by intelligence agencies, however they must take into account potential error
