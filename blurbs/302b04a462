GOAL

How Machine Learning Is Helping Morgan Stanley Better Understand Client Needs, helping financials advisors to give better advice with the help of machine learning methods.

DATA

None was mentioned

METHODS

Morgan Stanley’s wealth management business unit has been working for several years on a “next best action” system that financial advisors could use to make their advice both more efficient and more effective.

RESULTS

McMillan and his colleagues have considerable work to do in order to make all of the firm’s investing knowledge available through the system. They found, for example, that there was no artificial intelligence system available today that could take the knowledge embedded in investment analyst reports and make it available to support the choices presented to clients.

COMMENTS

Certainly, the robo aspects of this new system and process are a small part of the total. Neither Morgan Stanley’s business model nor its culture would fit well with an entirely machine-based solution for wealth management that provided no human support
