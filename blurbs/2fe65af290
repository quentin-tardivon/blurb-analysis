GOAL

To make smarter shopping sugegstions for offline customers in stores, using machine learning to suggest items that the
customer usually looks at and buys with another item. They aim to make shopping at physical stores as seamless and as
efficient as shopping online. They aim to stop the decline in offline shopping.

DATA

Customer's known shopping data such as items they usually put in their cart together (for example
hats with belts, shoes with socks, etc) and what they end up buying when they checkout.

METHODS

They used a deep learning algoriths to allow the AI to make smarter shopping decisions for the customer.
Sensors were placed in each garment of clothing in the store so that once in the changing room a large screen could allow
the customers to try on the garment in VR along with similar suggested garments.

RESULTS

The combination of this new technology known as FashionAI and ALibaba's existing technology allowed them to sell 
25 billion dollars worth of goods in one day.

COMMENTS

Clearly the FashionAI was a success in the 13 stores it was installed in for the trial run. It gives people an incentive to
physically shop instore and if it is extended to widespread use across the world in major retailers it could stop the decline
in brick-and-mortar shopping and benefit retailer and consumer alike.
