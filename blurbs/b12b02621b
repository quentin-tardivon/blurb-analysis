GOAL
To help solve problems in radiology image interpetation.
Including the likes of being able to reduce radiation does during CT scans
which would, with Machine Learning, make it safer and help produce better images
given this drop in dosage.
It can be used to reduce the time it takes to take an MRI scan in the same way,
being constucted from raw data from the scanner meaning there could be a possible 
drop in 50% in time for scans.
With better knowledge of images and the data they contain in a medical sense,
The possibility of an image search engine couold vastly improve the "guess work"
with images that are difficult for humans to clasify.

DATA
electronic health care databases including images in PACS, radiology reports and ordering information in Radiology Information Systems.
electronic health records that encompass information from other sources, including clinical notes laborator data and pathology records.
radiology images rich in metadata stored in the DICOM format.

METHOD
Deep Learning.

RESULTS
None Mentioned.

COMMENTS
This is a relatively new article and is undergoing.
can help interpet reports more accurately.
