GOAL
An algorithm for rectifying blind spot, using smartphone cameras, system for seeing around corners could help with self-driving cars and in search-and-rescue missions.

DATA
Data gathered from cameras, sensing systems etc. like lights by the edge of the wall, reflections of the objects around the camera. 

METHODS
Analyzing light at the edge of walls, which is impacted by the reflection of objects around the corner from the camera.

RESULTS
imaging system, which can work with smartphone cameras, uses information about light reflections to detect objects or people in a hidden scene and measure their speed and trajectory all in real-time.

COMMENTS
A really use full system with many real life applications like for eg: giving drivers warning a few seconds ahead in time before which can save many lives.
