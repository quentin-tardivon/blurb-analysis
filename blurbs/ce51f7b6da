GOAL

 Train a neural network to classify high resolution images

 DATA

 LSVRC-2010 contest (Contest held to create a image recognition software) 1.2 million labeled high resolution images.

METHODS
Using Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs)  along with the overall architecture being constructed of 8 layers with weights, first 5 being conventional layers while the remaining 3 are fully connected. With the sets of 4 pixels of the image being inputted into the system and an output of the top 5 most probably objects to be in the image in ascending order with the most probably at the top.



RESULTS
 
They achieved top-1 error (the top answer error rate) of 37.5 and top 5 error (the fraction of test images for which the correct label is not among the five labels considered most probable by the model) of 17% beating the previous best of 47.1% and 28.2% in the ILSVRC-2010 competition
 
COMMENTS
 
The results are defiantly impressive and an improvement on the previously impressive results but with a limited dataset although being large at 1.2million it is unsure how it would fare it a more realm world test.
