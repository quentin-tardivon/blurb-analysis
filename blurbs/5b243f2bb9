GOAL

To revolutionise marketing by introducing machine learning to analyse massive data on customer behaviour and identify trends and create advertisements which emotionally connect with users. 

DATA

Customer data from surveys, social media, reviews, public opinion etc

METHODS

Marketing departments want to use lexical analysis algorithms which learn from the ways humans react to different language and various ways of expressing the same idea.

RESULTS

Marketing campaigns which maximise emotional connection with the consumer in order to increase the chances of them purchasing the product. 

COMMENTS

This idea has been around for a long time, however, it is only starting to be employed on a wide basis as machine learning becomes accessible to even medium and small businesses.
