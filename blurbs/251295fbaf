Facebook

GOAL

To improve Facebook users' experience by detecting what posts they like to see in their newsfeed, and what posts they do not want to see.

DATA

Assessed how often users interacted (positively or negatively) with different kinds of posts in their newsfeed. Also used Facebook's option to ban certain pages/posts from your feed to predict what other pages/posts that user would not like.

METHODS

RESULTS

Facebook continues to be one of the largest and most succesful companies in the world, with over 2 billion active monthly users. This is in no small part due to the optimisation of the news feed, Facebook's main function (arguably aside from messenger). The team at Facebook seem to be very satisfied with what they have accomplished.

COMMENTS

As a long time Facebook user, I definitely have noticed the increase in quality of my news feed over time.
