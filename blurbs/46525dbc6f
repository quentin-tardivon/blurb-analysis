AGENT

Research scientist Janelle Shane.

GOAL

Generating original Halloween costume ideas.

DATA

A dataset was built by crowdsourcing costume ideas from blog readers.

METHODS

Neural Networks: Open-source char-rnn written in Torch. Learns each word letter by letter without any extra knowlege its meaning.

RESULTS

First results weren't great:

Sexy sexy Dombie Sexy Cat
Sexy A stare Rowan
Sexy RoR A the Rog
Sexy Cot
Sexy Purbie Lampire
Poth Rat

Reason: Varied dataset so it picked up on most common words first.

Eventually it got very good.

Punk Tree
Disco Monster
Spartan Gandalf
Starfleet Shark
A masked box
Martian Devil
Panda Clam
Potato man
Shark Cow
Space Batman
The shark knight

COMMENTS

Janelle has taken a similar approach to some of her other work. Including a craft beer, a heavy metal band, and my little pony name generators. Examples include: The Fine stranger(beer), Chaosrug(band) and Blue Cuss(pony).
