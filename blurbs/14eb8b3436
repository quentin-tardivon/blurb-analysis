AGENT: Marcel Just, Professor of psychology, Carnegie Mellon University. David Brent, University of Pittsburg.
GOAL: To develop brain imaging technology capable of identifying suicidal thoughts.
DATA: Research was carried out on 17 suicidal people and 17 'neurotypical' people, with no history of mental illness, as a control.
METHOD: Specifically coded algorithms coupled with an AI system that can detect significant pulses and patterns associated with suicidal thoughts.
RESULTS:  They were each presented with various keywords relating to death and the brain scanning system distinguished between the two groups with an accuracy rate of 91%.
COMMENT: This kind of system could be hugely beneficial for front-line clinicians and could help prevent thousands of suicides.
