AGENT
Knightscope K5 was developed by Knightscope Inc. Knightscope Inc is a
security company that builds Autonomous Data Machines to monitor shopping,
parking lots and neighbourhoods. 

GOAL 
K5's goal is to survey its surroundings and to "detect crime". The model
was developed in 2013, and is the oldest robot developed by Knightscope Inc.
It's duties include contacting the authorities should it detect abnormal
changes in data received from its sensors and cameras.

DATA 
The K5 creates a 3-D image of its surroundings. It uses an ultrasonic
sensor to detect objects in surroundings and monitors its own movements within
its environment.

METHODS 
The machine uses a combination of cameras, thermal imaging sensors, radar, air
quality sensors and a microphone to monitor its surroundings. The machine can
learn how to react to situations depending on previously obtained data from its
surroundings. Over time the robot can determine what is "normal" and will
create an alert if it deems any data "irregular".

RESULTS 
During the patrolling duties of one K5 robot tragedy struck. The
machine was unable to detect the steps leading to a water feature in The
Washington Harbour retail complex. 

The same model had previously been the public eye for knocking over a 16 month
old child.

COMMENTS 
The K5 appears to either suffer from the dreaded outdated curse, or
there exists a lack of interest with regards to developing the model. There may
be more appearances of Knightscope Inc. in the tabloids yet.
