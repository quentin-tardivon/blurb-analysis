GOAL

Apple started using deep learning for face detection in iOS 10.

DATA

they created a large dataset of image tiles of a fixed size corresponding to the smallest valid input to the network such that each tile produces a single output from the network. The training dataset is ideally balanced, so that half of the tiles contain a face (positive class) and the other half do not contain a face (negative class). For each positive tile, we provide the true location (x, y, w, h) of the face. 

METHODS

they trained the network to optimize the multitask objective described previously. Once trained, the network is able to predict whether a tile contains a face, and if so, it also provides the coordinates and scale of the face in the tile

RESULTS
