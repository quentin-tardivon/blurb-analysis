AGENT

Stanford Researchers.

GOAL

Wanted to develop an algorithm that evaluates chest x-rays for signs of diseases.

DATA

Researchers used a public dataset released by the National Institutes of Health Clinical Centre on 26th Sept. The dataset consisted of 112,120 frontal-view chest x-rays images labeled with 14 possible pathologies.

METHODS

None mentioned.

RESULTS

The algorithm could diagnose all 14 of the pathologies labeled in the x-ray accurately. It also outperformed the four Stanford radiologists in diagnosing pneumonia accurately.
