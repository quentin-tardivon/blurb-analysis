GOAL

Method for designing efficient computer chips may get miniature smart drones off the ground.

DATA	

Performance data of previous chips.

METHODS

Using various algorithms for designing efficient computer chips may get miniature smart drones off the ground.

RESULTS

A computer chip that uses a fraction of power of the larger drone computers and is tailored for a drone as small as a bottlecap.

COMMENTS

This could really help in miniaturising of chips.
