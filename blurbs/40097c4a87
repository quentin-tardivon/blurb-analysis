AGENT
MIT, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, and the University of California at Berkeley
GOAL
To automate the development of processes for producing materials. Scientists and engineers could provide the name of a material and be provided with suggested recipes.
DATA
Approximately 640,000 research papers.
METHODS
A combination of supervised and unsupervised techniques. Word2vec (an algorithm developed at Google which looks at the contexts in which words occur) was used to expand the data set.
RESULTS
A ML system that can isolate the recipes for materials from a paper and categorise the words in those recipes (eg into pieces of equipment, quantities, conditions etc).
