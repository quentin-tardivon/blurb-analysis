AGENT
A team of researchers from several institutions including Carnegie Mellon University and Harvard University.
GOAL
To develop a machine learning algorithm trained to understand neural representations of suicidal behaviour.
DATA
The researchers tested their technique in 17 patients with suicidal ideation, and in 17 more that served as control.
METHODS
They looked for suicidal brain patterns by watching how the patients' brains reacted when they were presented with six keywords: death, cruelty, trouble, carefree, good, and praise.
RESULTS
The algorithm was able to accurately identify 15 out of the 17 patients with suicidal ideation, and 16 out of 17 in the control group, for an overall accuracy of 91 percent.
COMMENTS
The results of their study have been published in the journal 'Nature Human Behaviour'.
