GOAL

Improve computer-aided image based diagnoses using machine learning and other AI
related techniques.

DATA

Images from MRI scans.

METHODS

"Deep neural networks." Catastrophically nonspecific. Also, "a variety of other
ML techniques."

RESULTS

Assessment of deep-learning-based pulmonary nodule detectors showed that none of
their outputs were the same: most focused on a particular aspect of the nodule
that was not clear from the training.

COMMENTS
