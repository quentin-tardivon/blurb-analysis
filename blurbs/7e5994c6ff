AGENT

Apple. Published on Apple's machine learning journal

GOAL

To EFFICIENTLY detect similar faces in images

DATA

There are two sets of images. An entire library of images, and the individuals personal images

METHODS

Standard neural nets are used for facial recognition,
but forms of cluster sampling are used to group these faces.
Apple write low-level algorithms to utilize their iPhones CPU and GPU for optimum efficiency

RESULTS

Succesfully groups faces from images with high percentage success.
Improving every year
