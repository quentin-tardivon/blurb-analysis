AGENT 
Amazon Go aims to provide a convenience store that epitomises
convenience. Amazon's team began developing this system four year ago. At the
moment the store in in Beta and is only available to Amazon employees.

GOAL 
Amazon Go is a checkout-free shop that allows its customers to simply walk
in, acquire what they need, and leave without having to queue to pay. In order to
participate in this shopping experience, first the customer must create an
Amazon account and download the Amazon Go app.

DATA 
Amazon uses SnapTell (bought company in 2009) integrated with other
technologies. Amazon claim that the same technologies used for self-driving
cars has been used for Amazon Go. Over time the behaviours of customers are
tracked, and will be used to improve future shopping experiences.

METHODS 
Computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning all combine to track
users and items alike. 

RESULTS 
There have been some reported issues surrounding tracking many
customers during one time. The sensors are unable to successfully track more
than 20 people approx.

COMMENTS 
It is not a question of "if" the store will be released to the public,
but "when". There may be more issues in to future surrounding people trying to
dupe the cameras and sensors, but I predict that in the future the amount of
successful shoplifters will steadily decline.
