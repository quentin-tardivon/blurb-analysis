AGENT

Adapt Centreâ€™s MT team at Dublin City University.

GOAL

Language Translation.

DATA

Source Sentence (English language sentence), human provided translation

METHODS

Neural Machine Translation

RESULTS

Using one language as a pivot language between the translation of 2 other languages. Example; lots of Engish-Arabic/English-Greek translation data, not much Arabic-Greek translation data. Use English as a pivot language for translation from Arabic to Greek and vice versa.

COMMENTS

Interesting use of MT in disaster response situations where translation may not be readily available.
