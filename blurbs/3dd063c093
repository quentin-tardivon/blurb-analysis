AGENT
Researchers from MITâ€™s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).
GOAL
To help robots understand context with a view to processing complex user requests.
DATA
The robot's environment
METHODS
Computer vision methods to help the robot to visualise its environment, followed by periodically storing their observations for future reference. This "episodic memory" can then be reviewed when a request is being processed.
RESULTS
When ComText was testing using a two armed robot (Baxter), the robot was able to perform 90% of the complex commands asked of it correctly.
