GOAL

Prediction ripeness of Bannannas to minimize food waste.

DATA

46 bananas, were used. Every days each bananas was photgraphed. Exteral factors such as temp, humidity and distance to camera was kept constant day to day. RGB data was then extracted from the photos.

METHODS

K-means clustering, knn and other algorithim were used and then compared against one another.

RESULTS

Results showed that bananas were at ripeness between days 26 and 31. Decision tree classifier was most effictive with 52% accuracy. Gaussian and knn followed with 51% and 50% accuracy respectively.

COMMENTS

Massive impication for making food industry more effiencent. It currently loses $15bn dollars to food waste every year.
