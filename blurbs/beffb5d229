AGENT 
Researchers at the University of Washington.

GOAL 
To analyse the significance of a character in a movie based upon their scripted dialogue.

DATA 
They used data obtained from the scripts of nearly 800 movies.

METHODS 
They used natural language processing tools, which rely on machine learning algorithms to identify characters that appeared as a verb's subject and object.

RESULTS 
The results showed a tendency for male characters to score higher on the tests of significance than female characters.

COMMENTS 
Implications of this can be used by future writers to see how much significance they are giving to a character based on the dialogue they are writing.
