Graphical Models for Machine Learning and Digital Communication

AGENT

GOAL

To Solve the problems in machine learning and digital communication deal with complex but sutured natural or artificial systems.

DATA

HE used Graphical models as an overarching framework to describe and solve problems in the area of pattern classification, unsupervised learning, data compression and channel coding.

METHODS

Bayesian belief networks and Markov random fields.

RESULTS

Error correcting codes used in the telephone modems and deep space communication consists of electrical signals that are linked together in a complex fashion determined by the designed code and the physical nature of the communication channel.

COMMENTS

With great clarity the cutting edge of research on the learning of graphical models, the compression of data using latent variable models, and the channel coding.
