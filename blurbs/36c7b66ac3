GOAL

Identify risk of developing coronary artery disease based on the genetic variation of a subject using single nucleotide polymorphisms as a signifier of genetic variation.


DATA

Two separate data sets which were taken from previous studies from ClinSeqÂ® and the Framingham Heart. These were composed of middle-aged Caucasian men due to their higher risk of advanced coronary artery disease. No indication the size of the sample sizes were given


METHODS

Random forests and neural networks were used to classify single nucleotide polymorphisms which are associated with coronary artery disease.

RESULTS

21 of the 56 Single nucleotide polymorphisms were classified as being predictive indicators of coronary artery disease. Those Single nucleotide polymorphisms were then used to identify genes which they are associated with.
