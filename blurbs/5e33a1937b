GOAL

An algorithm for your blind spot, using smartphone cameras, system for seeing around corners could help with self-driving cars and search-and-rescue.

DATA

Data gathered from cameras, sensing systems etc. For example : lights at the edge of the wall, reflections of objects around the camera. 

METHODS

Analyzing light at the edge of walls, which is impacted by the reflection of objects around the corner from the camera.

RESULTS

imaging system, which can work with smartphone cameras, uses information about light reflections to detect objects or people in a hidden scene and measure their speed and trajectory — all in real-time.

COMMENTS

A really use full system with many real life applications like for eg: giving drivers warning a few seconds ahead in time before which can save many lives.
