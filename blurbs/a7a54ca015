AGENT

A group of Australian robotics students

GOAL

To construct a robot that can accurately pick and stow items from bins to boxes in a short time.

DATA

Various images of items were gathered by the students. These images were preprocessed using algorithms and methods.

METHODS

Computer vision, artificial intelligence, neural networks.

RESULTS

The Australian team won the Amazon Robotics Challenge with a robot that stood above the rest.

COMMENTS

I have had an opportunity to join a team for this contest at Texas State. This is a rigorous event which Amazon holds every year. It really helps to have a deep background of machine learning and engineering to construct an effective robot to identify, pick, and stow items.
