AGENT

Amazon

GOAL

To improve Amazon's search function.

DATA

Assessed what keywords Amazon users searched for, and compare it to which items they went on to view and/or purchase.

METHODS

Amazong says that they "Automatically learn to combine multiple relevance features. Our catalog’s structured data provides us with many such relevance features and we learn from past search patterns and adapt to what is important to our customers."

RESULTS

Amazon is, of course, a hugely website. The search function is truly the backbone of the website - allowing users to find what they are looking for quickly and conveniently.

COMMENTS

The Amazon search feature has always been of great use to me.
