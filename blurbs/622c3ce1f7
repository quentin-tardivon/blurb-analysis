GOAL

an integrated framework for using Convolutional Networks for classi- fication, localization and detection. While other attempts have focus on object labeling this attempt was to locate multiple objects and their size in a particular image.

 DATA

Multiple different image collections but mainly referencing using the ImageNet(15million labeled high resolution images) dataset
 
METHODS
similar to the best ILSVRC12 architecture used by other attempts. But they improved on the network design and the inference steps. By using a separate function to categorize once an object was localized 

RESULTS
Their entry was the winner of the ILSVRC13 localization competition with 29.9% error (top 5).
COMMENTS
Their result was improved further post competition
