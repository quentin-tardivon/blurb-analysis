AGENT

GlaxoSmithKline

GOAL

GlaxoSmithKline used natural language and text analytics technology by Luminoso as a non-invasive solution for gaining insight into parents’ growing concerns about vaccinations

DATA

No data mentioned

METHODS

They applied algorithms to help sift through and tease out patterns of parent fears, including presumed links between vaccinations and autism, as a primary driver for avoiding vaccinations.

RESULTS

GSK used these detailed insights to help create new informational content that specifically addressed parents’ fears and provided incentive for following through with early childhood vaccinations.

COMMENTS

It is good to see machine learning used in ways such as this to provide people, especially parents, the data to show that the risks of autism and other things like this are low and put their minds at rest. Having an actual visual represention through graphs and things is reassuring for parents.
