GOAL

Process human patches to automatically infer code transforms for automatic patch generation.

DATA

Real-world patches and defects collected from 372 Java project

METHODS

Given a set of training pairs representing a program before and after a change the system intends to infer a set of transforms used for the search space. This search space is used when presented with a new program to try to generate a patch based on transforms used to fix bugs found in other projects. 

RESULTS

The system (Genesis) makes it possible to leverage the combined expertise and patch generation strategies of developers worldwide to automatically patch bugs in new applications.

COMMENTS

The system could prove to be very useful for the immediate detection and repairing of faults in new software projects.
