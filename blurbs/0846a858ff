AGENT

Ianniz Xenakis, for his 1958 compositions, 
describing his process in 
"Formalized Music: Thought and Mathematics in compositions

GOAL

To algorithmically generate musical compositions

DATA

A database of Musical compositions and instrumental data

METHODS

Markov Chains, used to model probabilstic systems,
take advantage of existing material.

RESULTS

Iannz Xenakis managed to compose his own music algorithmically,
this was before the time of computational machines,
now this can be extended even further.
