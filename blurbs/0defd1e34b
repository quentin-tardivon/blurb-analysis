AGENT

Andres Gomez et al. (see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.06193.pdf)

GOAL

Increase security, specifically with respect to the ALICE (A Large Ion Collider
Experiment) Pb-Pb detector's production environment, specifically, via intrusion
prevention (no ML involved) and detection (ML involved).

DATA

All data generated during job runs (log entries, traces, syscalls, etc.)

METHODS

Further reading into the arxiv paper revealed that the machine learning
techniques are 'proposed' for job metric analysis, essentially allowing them to
detect abnormal situations by learning what a normal situation looks like
(binary classification). They suppose SVMs (support vector machines) may be
useful due to their successful application in other security applications.

RESULTS

No results as of yet, since the paper merely promises future ML work.
