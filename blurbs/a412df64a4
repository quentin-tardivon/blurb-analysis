GOAL

The aim of the study was to improve the ability to determine whether a new drug works in the brain.

DATA

Gaze direction, objectively measured from the eyes as seen on head CT scans upon hospital admission and from MRI scans typically done 1-3 days later.

METHODS

The specific machine learning technique was not described simply referring it to it as  "high-dimensional machine learning methods"

RESULTS

Their technique is reported to be able to determine if drug impact is significant when the lesion was shrunk by only 55% as opposed to 78.4% by conventional methods.

COMMENTS

This a low detail article which appears to more describe the hopefull ambitions of the use of machine learning as opposed to the current application.
Although no specific machine learning method was mentioned it is likely that convolution neural networks were used as they were working with CT scan image data.
