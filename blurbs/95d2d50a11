GOAL
The goal of the research discussed was to determine the best of two alternate educational methods. The methods in question are teacher-directed and student-driven. The researchers aimed to provide a scientific answer as to whether or not one is better than the other.
DATA
The data comes from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, which tests 15-year-olds around the world on mathematics, reading, and science every three years. The 2015 data set was used in this research.
METHODS
The researchers measured the average score increase/decrease of students when utilising the two teaching methods to various degrees, ranging from 'None to Few Lessons' to 'Many to All Lessons'
RESULTS
It was found that the greatest learning gains occured when many-to-all of the lessons were teacher-directed and some-to-many of the lessons were student-driven. The worst result occurred when none-to-few of the lessons were teacher-directed and many-to-all of the lessons were student-driven.
COMMENTS
There is a caveat in the article, in that the report notes that student-driven teaching increases students' joy in the subject significantly, which is belived to be why a mix of teaching methods is best.
