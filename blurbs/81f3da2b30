GAOL
Dynamically detect malware in Android Applications

DATA
A critical challenge is the need for the collection and experimentation with a large dataset for training malware classifiers, typically spanning hundreds of applications and thousands of feature vectors. These datasets can be difficult to collect accurately, as there is an inherent tradeoff between profiling malware operating maliciously, such as gaining network access on a mobile device, and ensuring that both the malware remains within its sandbox and the malware profile remains accurate

METHODS
They used STREAM to send 10,000 input events to each application in the data set and collect a feature vector every 5 seconds. They collected over thirty features in each vector. Feature vectors collected from the training set of applications were used to create classifiers, and then feature vectors from the testing set are used to evaluate the created malware classifiers. Classification rates from the testing set are based on the 47 testing applications used.

RESULTS
Results in testing these classifiers show detection rates from 68.75% to 81.25%
