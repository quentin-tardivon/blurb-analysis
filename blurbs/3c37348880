GOAL
Use machine learning to improve our ability to determine whether a new drug works in the brain.
DATA
The research team looked at large-scale data from patients with stroke, extracting the complex anatomical pattern of brain damage caused by the stroke in each patient.
METHODS
The machine learning algorithm took into account the presence or absence of damage across the entire brain, treating the stroke as a complex "fingerprint", described by a multitude of variables.
RESULTS
Conventional methods would only detect an effect in a trial if the lesion was shrunk by 78.4% of its volume, while the machine learning method would detect an effect when the lesion was shrunk by only 55%.
COMMENTS
The researchers say their finding demonstrate that machine learning could be invaluable to medical science, especially when the system under study - such as the brain - is highly complex.
