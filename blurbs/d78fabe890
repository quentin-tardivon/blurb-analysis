AGENT

A team of computer scientists based at the University of Granada.

GOAL

Recognising gun in video.

DATA

ImageNet 1.28million images. + 3000 extra hangun images.

METHODS

VGG-16 model finetuned with 3000 handgun images.

RESULTS

Recognises handguns in even low qualities youtube videos. It does this in under 0.3 seconds. An alarm is raised if more than 5 positives are found in under 0.2 seconds or 27 scenes.

COMMENTS
