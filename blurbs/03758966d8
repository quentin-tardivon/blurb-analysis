GOAL
To develop a system that could accurately distinguish patients with suicidal ideations from those without so as 
to aid medical professionals in treating them. 

DATA
79 young adults who were either currently experiencing suicidal ideation or were controls with no prior history were
assessed for depression, anxiety etc. FMRI was also used during interviews where subjects were asked to actively think
about 30 concept 10 related to suicide, 10 positive and 10 negative.

METHODS
Data from fMRI was used to identify locations that were similar based on responses to the exercise. This was further
distilled into specific locations for neural semantic representation of these concepts which was then fed to their machine
learning algorithms which learned how to distinguish between the suicidality, positive and negative emotion represented by
a given patients fMRI.

RESULTS
Model was able to distinguish between those with suicidal ideation and those without and was even able to distinguish between
attempters and non-attempters within the ideation group.
