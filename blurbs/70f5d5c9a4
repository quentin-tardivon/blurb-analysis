AGENT
George Biros, professor of mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, along with collaborators from the University of Pennsylvania, University of Houston, and University of Stuttgart.
GOAL
The goal was to create a system which could characterize gliomas, the most common and aggressive type of primary brain tumor.
DATA
The system was calibrated with training data consisting of 300 sets of brain images. The system was then then tested on data from 140 patients.
METHODS
The system has two main steps: a supervised machine learning step where the computer creates a probability map for the target classes, and a second step where they combine these probabilities with a biophysical model that represents how tumors grow in mathematical terms, which imposes limits on the analyses and helps find correlations.
RESULTS
Biros and his team were able to run their analysis pipeline on 140 brains in less than 4 hours and correctly characterized the testing data with nearly 90 percent accuracy, which is comparable to human radiologists.
COMMENTS
The methods that the team developed go beyond brain tumour identification. They are applicable to many problems in medicine as well as in physics, including semiconductor design and plasma dynamics.
