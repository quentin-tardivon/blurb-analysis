AGENT 

Every major financial institution.

GOAL

To use machine learning to optimise profit from trade.

DATA

Past financial data and current news stories related to the stocks.

METHODS

The machines use a variety of algorithms to analyse and act on past financial history
and current news stories to participate in high-frquency tading and trade in billions
of dollars every day. The machines attempt to spot stocks which when bought can be sold
quickly for a profit, no matter how small.

RESULTS

Currently 73 percent of everyday trading is executed by machines, meaning that billions
of dollars every single day are entrusted to the decisions that these machines make
with regards to buying and selling stocks.

COMMENTS

Clearly the machines are working as financial institutions are using them, but they are 
not without their faults. Sometimes they can behave abnormally, such as the 'Flash Crash'
in 2010 in which the market fell and then recovered after only 36 minutes due to abnormal
behaviour by the machines.
The future of machines in stocks is looking to automaticall improve profits and portfolios
for companies, eliminating the human risk that is currently part and parcel of the industry.
