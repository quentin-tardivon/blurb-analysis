AGENT

Originated by Richard Zhang and built on by a team of researchers at UC Berkeley.
Utilized by Photoshop and expected to be incorporated in the next release.

GOAL

To automatically colorize black and white photos

DATA

It is easy to convert colored images to grayscale.
Hence, millions of colored images were used as a training set.

METHODS

A feed-forward convoluted Neural Network was used.
The training set consisted of millions of colorized photos.
These were grayscaled and sent in as an input to the FFNN, and trained on the original colorised version as an output.
This is a form of supervised machine learning.
8 layers were used in the FNN. This form of deep machine learning is necessary.
The first layer determines an overall estimate of the scene and its appropriate colors.
As the Neural net gets deeper more specific colors are applied to individual objects.

RESULTS

20 percent of the photo pairs actually fooled the humans.
This means the colorized versions were guessed as the real color photos.
This fool rate is much higher than prior research in this area.

COMMENTS

As this becomes more efficient, the algorithm can be applied to frames to create colorized videos.
At this moment it costs about 2000 euro per minute to colorize a video.
