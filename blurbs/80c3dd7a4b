AGENT 

PayPal

GOAL

To detect fraudsters and money launderers

DATA

Data from the customer's purchasing history, in addition to reviewing patterns of likely fraud.

METHODS	

PayPal uses Deep Learning algorithms to analyze patterns to detect fraud. When a pattern is revealed, for example, if sudden strings of many small purchases at convenience stores turn out to be fraud, it's turned into a "feature", or a rule that can be applied in real time to stop purchases that fit this profile.

RESULT

With each positive detection PayPals fraud detection model becomes more and more proficient.

COMMENTS

This system was first introduced in 2013 and from the 100 first implemented cases of fraud, PayPals model has "learned" over 1000 more!
