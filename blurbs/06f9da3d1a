GOAL

Creation of 'infrastructure-free' navigation, in particular in self-driving

car, which allow the car to generate a 3D structure of the world around it.

METHODS

The specific techniques used are not discussed at all.

RESULTS

Results are not discussed, however their description of the system heavily indicates
that it is still very much a work-in-progress.
