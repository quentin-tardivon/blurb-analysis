GOAL

Develop a system to separate individual sounds out when multiple sources are present.

DATA

Wall Street Journal stories read by people (CSR-I : WSJ0)

METHODS

Speech separation was performed by constructing time-domain speech signals based on clusters of time-frequency masks for each speaker. Various clustering methods were used: k-means clustering on each segment; k-means clustering on all segment;  spectral clustering within each segment.

RESULTS

System outperforms the Oracle NMF algorithm that was used as a baseline for comparisons. Can separate individual voices from a combined source, and while the system was trained on English voices only is able to separate different languages as well. 

COMMENTS

The system could see a lot of use with the increase in home automation/assistant systems such as Google Home and Amazon Echo.
