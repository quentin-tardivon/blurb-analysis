GOAL
To show that modelling the human brain via machine learning could help testing drug effects that would not be evident from animal trials
DATA
Large-scale data from stroke patients with indexes for the impact of strokes
METHODS
Simulated hypothetical drugs
RESULTS
The machine learning techniques employed show the full pattern of damage across the brain and allowed theraputic effects to be detected with greater sensitivity
COMMENTS
