GOAL

Develop faster collision detection algorithms for robots that operate in human environments.

DATA

Sensor data from the robot.

METHODS

Fastron algorithm used to classify collisions versus non-collisions points.

RESULTS

Fastron algorithm can run up to 8 times faster than traditional collision detection algorithms.

COMMENTS

Interesting use of machine learning in robot-assisted surgeries.
