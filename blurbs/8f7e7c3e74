Classify Images with Deep Neural Networks

DATA
1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest

METHODS
The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax.  To make training faster, they used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers they employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective.

RESULTS
The network achieves top-1 and top-5 test set error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%. The best performance achieved during the competition was 47.1% and 28.2%.
