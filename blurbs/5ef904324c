AGENT

Cardiogram and University of California, San Francisco.

GOAL

To find out if data from Apple Watch can be used to predict hypertension or sleep apnea. 

DATA

Heart-rate and step count data from Apple Watches of over 6,000 volunteers combined with information about their health.

METHODS

They trained the kinds of artificial neural networks that are often used in speech recognition systems.

RESULTS

With only one week of data from the wearer, their algorithm can predict hypertension with an accuracy of about 80 percent, and sleep apnea with an accuracy of about 90.

COMMENTS

More testing needs to be done to fully evaluate the usefulness of the findings in medicine.
