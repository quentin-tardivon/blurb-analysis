GOAL

Using the essential tools for rapid growth of bio informatics field.
Building computer systems that can adapt to environments and learn from experience has attracted researchers from many field.

DATA

Biological data required and automated analysis. Generous of many important species have been completely sequenced, new technologies of DNA and protein array have been practical research tools.


METHODS

Bayesian reasoning,  Maximum entropy methods, Gaussian processes and support vector machines.


RESULTS

Full genome sequencing has blossomed with the completion of the sequence of the fly and the draft of the human genome project.


COMMENTS
The improvement of bioinformatics is essential in the important face of technology and machine learning will have an greater impact.
