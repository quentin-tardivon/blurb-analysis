AGENT
A team from Sandia National Laboratories and Boston University

GOAL
Develop a system that could perform diagnostic tests on supercomputers

DATA
The team compiled a collection of issues they had come across in their time working with supercomputers and then 
created code that would induce those  problems. Next they ran a variety of programs on computers with and without 
their anomalous code. They collected information on the energy, processor and memory used and this was provided to their 
algorithms to learn from.

METHODS
One of the techniques used was Random Forest which was highly effective at processing the vast number of data points. 
This was later streamlined further by using averages, fifth percentile and 95th percentile in certain calculations.

RESULTS
Resulted in a program that could use less than 1% of the systems processing power to analyse data and fix these 
problems in the background.
