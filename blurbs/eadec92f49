GOAL 

See & Spray Weed Killing technology - To detect and identify individual plants and make decisions on how to treat each plant individually. Reducing the use of herbicides, & allowing the replacement of some herbicides with organic ones, thereby reducing monetary cost, reducing impact on environment, reducing the levels of herbicides making it into the food chain and reducing the likelihood of weeds growing resistance to herbicides. Crop yields would also be expected to improve. Historically weeds are treated on a grand scale, by the field, including the spraying of the desired crop with a general purpose weed killer which is designed to hit as many of the varieties of weeds as possible. This Machine Learning method will reduce herbicide usage by up to 95%.
