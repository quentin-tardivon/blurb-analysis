Global Good Fund - joint venture between Bill Gates and Motec, a China based company 
specialising in microscope manufacturing.

GOAL

To identify and count the number of malaria parasites in a blood sample to help and fight
the disease.

DATA

Blood samples taken from those who are known to be infected with malaria - there are 
millions of cases every year so there is endless data

METHODS

The microscope, called the EasyScan Go, will be installed with image recognition software
so that it can 'see' the blood smears and be trained to identify the parasites. It will
use a machine learning algorithm to get better at identifying the parasites.

RESULTS

At present the researchers have shown the the EasyScan Go is as reliable as an expert
microscopist in identifying the parasite from a sample.

COMMENTS

The possibilites for a technology like this are endless - it could lead to any disease
which is held in the blood being able to be identified by machines instead of humans.
This would mean that more cases would be caught early on and so would lead to less deaths.
