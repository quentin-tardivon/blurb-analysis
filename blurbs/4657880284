GOAL

To improve on existing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnostic and screening tools. 

DATA

The data used consisted of the test scores of 1264 people with ASD and 462 with non-ADS disorders.  The test results were obtained using the Autusm Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and Social Reponsiveness Scale (SRS) tests. 

METHODS

A support vector machine (SVM) was used to create the algorithms.  A multi-level cross-validation was used to test the algorithms performance.  A second layer of cross-validation of each training set was used to tune parameters and select features.  The first layer used 5-fold cross-validation and the second layer used 3-fold cross-validation on the training data for the first-layer. 

RESULTS

Algorithms were able to reach 89% specificity for individuals under 10 years old and 87% for those above 10.  They also enabled identification of redundancies in the questions asked during the tests and identify five ADI-R questions that were able to keep 95% of instrument performance.

COMMENTS

Data was only included for verbal individuals due to the limited amount of data available for nonverbal individuals
