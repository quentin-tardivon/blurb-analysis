AGENT 
A team of researchers from Stony Brook Universityâ€™s Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Department.

GOAL 
To teach a machine learning algorithm to help in increasing the performance of catalysts in order to drive reactions toward desired chemical products more speedily.

DATA 
They used X-ray data that was collected and used by a computer to decipher 3D nanoscale structures.

METHODS 
N/A

RESULTS 
N/A

COMMENTS 
The algorithm results in being able to study the structure/architecture of a catalyst while they are reacting.
