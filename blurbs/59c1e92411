Apple engineers.

GOAL

Using deep learning to improve the iPhones facial detection utilizing only onn device information.

DATA

iPhone owners photo library.

METHODS

Deep Learning using the OverFeat approach. This approach utilises deep convolutional networks to scan images.

RESULTS

Apple successfully managed to create a deep learning facial recognition algorithm that was able to correctly identify if a face was present in an image tile while only running on device. 

COMMENTS

This is impressive due to the resource limitations posed by running the entire algorithm on a mobile phone.
