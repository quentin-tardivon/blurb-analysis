AGENT 

FACEBOOK

GOAL 

To recognise people in photos and use this to suggest friends or suggest who to tag in the photo

DATA 

Pictures uploaded to facebook of themselves and pictures people upload containing other people.

METHODS 

Facebook employs a deep learning app they have developed called DeepFace which learns to recognise people in photos. This neural network is fed all the available pictures of the user to generate a set of values corresponding to that person, these are then used to identify these people in other pictures that their friends perhaps may have shared.

RESULTS 

The neural network was remakably successful being regarded as one of the most advanced image recognition tools beating humans in extensive testing where the goal was to discern if 2 different images are of the same person. The success rate for DeepFace was 97% and the success rate for humans was 96%

COMMENTS 

This was a very successful bit of software but it got removed in 2013 from European accounts due to issues with infringing on privacy where people argued that with high level images of a crowd DeepFace could start putting names to faces it can see.
