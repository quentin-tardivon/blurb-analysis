AGENT
Netflix.com

GOAL
The goal of Netflix was to improve their current success rate in predicting user ratings of certain films by 10%. This would improve the way that they recommended new content to users. The competition was open to the public to come up with such an algorithm with 1 million dollars offered to the first group to do so. 

DATA

Flat files containing demographic information about users and the ratings they had given certain films. Information was given in a separate flat file about these films such as their genre and release year. 

METHODS

The system that Netflix eventually implemented for recommendations by Netflix was a mixture of Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Singular Value Decomposition

RESULTS
Singular Value Decomposition produced a root mean squared error of 0.8914, Restricted Boltzmann Machines produced a root mean squared error of 0.8990. A blend of both models reduced this error to 0.88. 


COMMENTS
Interestingly, this was not the winner of the challenge as it didnt improve the Netflix algorithm by 10%. Netflix found that the winning entry which did so was too challenging to implement and that the small advantage it gave over simpler models wasnt enough to justify the investment.
