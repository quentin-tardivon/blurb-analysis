AGENT:

GOAL:use machine leaning to help improve climate forecasts

DATA:

Methods:Use machine leaning to first go through the data available to create models of climate change and secondly use macine learning to create algoritms to predict forest fires	

Results:creates models of the climate and continue to do so better models are formed and make improved forecasts
