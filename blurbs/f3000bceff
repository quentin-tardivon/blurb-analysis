AGENT
Andreas Keller, Leslie Vosshall
GOAL
Their algorithm tries to guess molecule's smell from it's structure.
DATA
They had 49 volunteers who will rate the odour of 476 chemicals and asked them to match those smells with 19 descriptors.
METHOD
They released these datas and invited everybody who can develop a logical algorithm.
RESULTS
Problem was human nature is not that reliable. Because the same volunteers when they get into the test again they were not rating the same odour with the first one.
COMMENTS
Sometimes as we can see in this example, the limits are human nature and behaviours.
