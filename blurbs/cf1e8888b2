GOAL

To evaluate numerous classifiers from an assortment of different families, and use numerous data sets representing the whole UCI data-base in order to achieve significant conclusions about the classifier behaviour, not dependent on the data set collection

DATA

Evaluated 179 classifiers arising from 17 families and used 121 data sets representing the whole UCI data-base to achieve their goal.



METHODS

Evaluation of 170 classifiers belonging to a wide collection of 17 families over the whole UCI machine learning classification database to achieve significant conclusions about the classifier behaviour, not dependent on the data set collection.


RESULTS

The best results are achieved by the parallel random forest (parRF t), implemented in R with caret, tuning the parameter mtry. The parRF t achieves in average 94.1% of the maximum accuracy over all the data sets (Table 5, lower part), and overcomes the 90% of the maximum accuracy in 102 out of 121 data sets
