AGENT: Yelp

GOAL: Image Curation at Scale

DATA: The images on their website

METHODS: They used picture classification technology. Their learning algorithms helped the company’s staff to compile, categorize and label images more efficiently.

RESULTS: They manages to make the images an appropriate size and make the interface of their website a lot more appealing.

COMMENTS: I think this is a great idea and would be great for clothes websites to display an appropriate amount of clothes on a web page, thus increasing their chances of people making orders, or in this case, leaving a review.
