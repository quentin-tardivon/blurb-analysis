AGENT 

Martin Abadi, David Andersen and researchers at Google Brain, Googles's Deep Learning dept.

GOAL

To use machine learning to teach computers how to encrypt messages.

DATA

Plaintext chosen by the researchers to be encrypted.

METHODS

Three computers - Alice, Bob and Eve. Alice had to send an encrypted message to Bob who had
to decrypt it, while Eve had to eavedrop and attempt to decrypt the message. They used 
repeated trials to allow the machines to learn how to come up with their own encryption
algorithm and to improve it.

RESULTS

The machines were slow to learn, but after 15,000 trials Alice and Bob were successful,
and Eve could only decrypt half of the encrypted bits, which is the same as pure chance as
the bits are either 1 or 0.

COMMENTS

Because the machines had to come up with their own encryption algorithm, it is difficult
to tell how secure the algorithm is. At present there aren't many uses for this technology,
but as machine learning is improved upon these techniques could grow and could be used to
securely encrypt our data against hackers.
