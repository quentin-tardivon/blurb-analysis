AGENT

Vladimir Iglovikov, Sergey Mushinskiy

GOAL

Detect and label 10 classes of objects including waterways, vehicles, and buildings from satellite imagery.

DATA

Satellite data that is given both in visual and lower frequency regions. Data was divided into train (25 images) and test (32 images) sets.

METHODS

Class distributions, Water Classes, Neural Networks, Loss function, Test time augmentation

RESULTS

We decrease variance of the predictions. Images are split in tiles in a different way and this helps to decrease local boundary effects.

COMMENTS

The Defence and Technology Laboratory challenged people to apply novel techniques to "train the eye in the sky", hence the creation of this competition and results.
