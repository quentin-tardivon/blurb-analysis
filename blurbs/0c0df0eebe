AGENT

The OpenAI research team.

GOAL

Defeating professional players in a 1v1 scenario in the game Dota 2.

DATA

The bot had access to the Dota 2 bot API, and hence theoretically had access to
lots of information about the game that humans do not have access to. However,
besides this and some basic incentives for winning, the bot had no access to any
external data; it simply played against itself.

METHODS

While we know initial creep blocks were trained using reinforcement learning
techniques, they have stated that they're not yet ready to talk about the
methods employed.

RESULTS

The bot sucessully defeated Arteezy (top overall player) and SumaiL (top 1v1)
quite decisively, with SumaiL describing the bot as unbeatable.

COMMENTS

There are a few issues with the way the bot is trained: first, the bot only
learned to play a single character (there are however over 100 in-game), and
secondly, the bot has access to information not available to a human. For
example, the bot was able to very accurately determine the range of a particular
skill, often using the skill the moment its opponent was in range, and
cancelling that skill the moment its opponent was out of range, which is
impossible for a human player to replicate. Coupled with the obviously superiour
reaction times of the bot, it's not entirely surprising that it would eventually
beat a human player.
