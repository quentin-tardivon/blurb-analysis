GOAL 
biological network modeling to identify new targets for disease. 

DATA 
high-throughput experiments that measure the interactions among all of the molecules during disease

METHODS 
using machine learning algorithm to analyse which molecular interaction are specific to the disease

RESULTS 
it has been used in reducing the time taken by the drugs to reach to customer after proper testing and help in development

COMMENTS 
such research can help reduce the cost of medicne and time taken by them to cure diseases
