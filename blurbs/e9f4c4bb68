GOAL

To find an improved method for predicting heart attacks

DATA

The data was obtained from the patient records at Sutter Health.  32,784 records were used, 3,884 were those for patients who had heart attacks within an 18 month period and the remainder were used as a control group.  Factors to be considered included diagnosis, medication, procedure codes and summaries of doctor visits.

METHODS

The team used Recurrent neural networks and gated recurrent units to find relations between the different factors over time (diagnosis, medication etc).  They also used regularized logistic regression, k,-nearest neighbor, SVM and multilayer perceptrons and used these to compare the prefomance of their model against.

RESULTS

The GRU model was found to achieve the best results achieving an area under the curve of 0.883.

COMMENTS

The researchers believe that the approach they have taken could be used to predict any disease, not just the risk of a heart attack.
