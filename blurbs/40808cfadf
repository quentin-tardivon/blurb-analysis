GOAL

Use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn and predict a persons
preferred style of clothing.

DATA

Data scraped from Amazon: shoes, tops, and pants (all for both women and men).

METHODS

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used to learn and classify a users
preferences, which was then used to train a GAN that could generate fake images
of clothing that the user may like.

RESULTS

While good at generating specific items of clothing matching the persons style,
it has no real sense of what makes a cohesive outfit.
