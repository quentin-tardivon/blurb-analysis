AGENT
Stanford researchers 
GOAL
An algorithm that offers diagnoses based off chest X-ray images
DATA
A dataset contains 112,120 frontal-view chest X-ray images labeled with up to 14 possible pathologies
METHODS
420 of the images were annotated for the test set. They then used a training algorithm.
RESULTS
They created an algorithm which exceeds the perfor-mance of radiologists in detecting pneumonia fromfrontal-view chest X-ray images.
