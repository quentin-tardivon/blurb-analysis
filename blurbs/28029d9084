AGENT 
A team of researchers from the University of Cambridge, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Boston University.

GOAL 
To develop a method to predict earthquakes.

DATA 
Used simulations of earthquakes to obtain the data needed.

METHODS 
They used machine learning to develop a system that studied the relationship between a sound made by a fault line and how close it was to causing an earthquake.

RESULTS 
The researchers were able to analyse the sound and use it to aid in detecting an earthquake.

COMMENTS 
While these experiments were done using simulations, the research team hopes to scale up the experiments and apply it to real life systems.
