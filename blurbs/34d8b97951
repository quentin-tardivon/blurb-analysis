GOAL

To transform simple sketches into works of art inspired by Van Gogh, Cezanne and Picasso. Vincent interprets a human drawing and the completes the piece for them.

DATA

Researchers showed the computer thousands of paintings from the Renaissance period to current day.

METHODS

Researchers trained the computer on contrast, colour and texture. Researchers used machine learning approaches such as adversarial training, perceptual loss, and end-to-end training of stacked networks.

RESULTS

Vincent can interpret edges and lines being drawn and pick up where the user left off, producing a complete picture.
