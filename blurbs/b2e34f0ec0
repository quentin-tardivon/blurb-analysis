AGENT
The agent is Apple with their new iPhone, the iPhone X or 10.

GOAL
The goal is to create a facial detection system called face id to replace the industry’s standard finger print sensor touch id.

DATA
The phone front 2D camera gathers the user’s face data.

METHODS
The facial recognition requires four separate components which work together to scan the users face. The Dot Projector projects 30,000 dots onto a user’s face to build their unique facial map.
Then an infrared camera reads the dot pattern, captures an infrared image and sends it to the phones processor, the A11 bionic chip to confirm a match. 
The flood illuminator help to identify a user’s face even when it’s dark by making sure that the colour reproduction is on par with the temperature and surrounding light.
Since all of these components work at a short distance, the proximity sensor wans a user when they are out of reach when using face id.
Apple further claims that Facial id uses machine learning to improve the recognizing speed and accuracy over usage.

RESULTS
This new security feature has boosted a huge improvement over their previous touch id feature. The probability that a random person in the population could unlock your phone by face id is approximately 1 in 1,000,000 versus I was 1 in 50,000 with touch id.

COMMENTS
Although I am amazed by the advancements in user identification, I am still happy with the current touch id feature. The face id technology is still fairly new and there have been a number of bugs present with the current implementation of this technology.
