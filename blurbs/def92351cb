Machine learning and big data are having a positive impact on customer experience, as well as producing extensive benefits for banks

GOALS
Combined with machine learning it can be used to identify and profile customers through a host of personal and device characteristics. Furthermore, this can all be done in real time, without any need for conscious input by the end user. Deviations and abnormalities that might indicate a risk can be highlighted and challenged with a far greater degree of speed, subtlety and precision.

DATA
By continuously analysing the vast array of data being generated by digital banking ecosystems, it has become possible to create a unique footprint for every single customer. Furthermore, effective deployment of machine learning and big data can support sophisticated real-time assessment of the risk inherent in every single online transaction.

RESULTS
Analysis of device characteristics is equally sophisticated, including the ability to detect the use of cloaking services to hide an IP address, for example. With all these tools combined it is possible to automatically spot a vast range of anomalous behaviour. Crucially, these capabilities extend far beyond traditional solutions, which are typically based on a relatively limited and inflexible set of fraud indicators.

COMMENTS
Imagining a digital banking experience where we can identify ourselves with absolute certainty, simply by being ourselves, is enticing.
