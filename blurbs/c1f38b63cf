AGENT

Makoto Koike

GOAL

Automate the process of sorting cucumbers in his parents farm.

DATA

7000 pictures of the cucumbers, sorted by his mother, where used to train the dataset.

METHODS

Makoto used a softmax regression complemented by a convolutional network. He used TensorFlow to apply the model.

RESULTS

After completion, Makoto validated his model with the test image and obtained an accuracy of 95%, however there is room for improvement. He suspects the accuracy is so high because the model is overfitting. Furthermore, the model can only classify on a few parameters, such as shape, length and level of distortion leaving other characteristics such as colour, texture and scratches out of the equation.

COMMENTS

The idea of the problem is not very different from identifying digits. I like how he used it to improve a very manual method. Would be interesting to use computer vision to analyse texture and scratches on the surface of the cucumbers and add it to the training model.
