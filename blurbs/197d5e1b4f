GOAL

To test "Google Vizier" by checking how well it can design cookies

DATA

Baked some recipies in the smaller scale run-through to provide useful data for further baking.

METHODS

Automatically optimising hyperparameters of machine learning models. "Transfer learning", effictively learning from experience using data from previous studies.

RESULTS

While it took a while and few bumps like making the cookies spicy, after a number of rounds the cookies improved significantly and were highly rated and delicious.

COMMENTS

Surprisingly doing something as simply checking if the AI can generate delicious cookies is a great test to see if the AI is well developed.
