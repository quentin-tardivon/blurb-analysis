AGENT

IBM

GOAL

Wanted to create a machine that could play chess better than a chess grandmaster.

DATA

Had the machine play against numerous pro players and recorded the results.

METHODS

Had the machine constantly play 1v1 against itself; learning what strategies led to wins more often that not. Once ready, was entered into the World Computer Chess Championship, where it tied for second place. A year later, it was pitted against chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov.

RESULTS

The machine, named Deep Blue, managed to win the first game of six against Kasparov. However, Kasparov won 3 of the following 5 games, and drew the other two, resulting in a 4-2 win against the machine. A year later, they played again, with Deep Blue winning 3.5-2.5. Deep Blue was then retired.

COMMENTS

This was one of the first big displays of the potential power of machine learning. Chess grandmasters are extremely talented induviduals, capable of planning every move approximately 4 turns ahead. Deep Blue, however, was said to have been capable of planning up to 8 turns ahead, and managed to take the victory. As a fan of chess, I found this story extremely impressive.
