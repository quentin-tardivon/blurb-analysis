AGENT

Researchers from Google and MIT.

GOAL

To use machine learning models to improve pictures automatically right after they've been captured. This requires a low computational cost from the model.

DATA

Dataset created by Adobe and MIT consisting of 5,000 original images and a set of five touches made to each image by a photography student.

METHODS

Convolutional neural networks were used to process a low resolution version of the image and the output was fed to an affine transformation. Finally a three-dimensional grid was used to produce the changes to be made to the photos. 

RESULTS

They were able to run the application on a mobile platform with low battery drain and low computational cost. The goodness of the produced photos was not evaluated objectively.

COMMENTS 

According to Google's computational photography leader, they are only beginning to scratch the surface with their work.
