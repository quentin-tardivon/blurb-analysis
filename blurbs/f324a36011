GOAL
To show how an ensemble of regression trees can be used to estimate the face’s landmark positions
directly from a sparse subset of pixel intensities, achieving super-realtime performance 
with high quality predictions.

DATA
A dataset of many facial photos of human beings.

METHODS
This  paper  presents  an  algorithm  to  precisely  estimate the position of facial landmarks
 in a computationally efficient way.  Similar to previous works: 
X. Cao, Y. Wei, F. Wen, and J. Sun.  Face alignment by explicit shape regression.  In
CVPR, pages 2887–2894, 2012,
P. Dollar, P. Welinder, and P. Perona.  Cascaded pose regression. In
CVPR, pages 1078–1085, 2010.
The proposed method utilizes a cascade of regressors



RESULTS
We described how an ensemble of regression trees can be used to regress the location
of facial landmarks from a sparse subset of intensity values extracted from an input image.
The presented framework is faster in reducing the error compared to previous work and can 
also handle partial or uncertain labels.
