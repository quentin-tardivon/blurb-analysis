AGENT

MIT’s CSAIL team

GOAL

Given a still image of a dish filled with food, CSAIL team's deep-learning algorithm recommends ingredients and recipes.

DATA

Photos on social media can provide valuable insight into health habits and dietary preferences.

METHODS

This system predicts recipes from photos using a neural network, a way to achieve machine learning in which a computer lears to perform tasks by analysing examples.

RESULTS

It can take a photo of an entrée and suggest a similar recipe to it.

COMMENTS

Huge potential in food related use of machine learning as it can also increase the data-set for further research for the same.
