AGENT

Vodacom 

GOAL

When you use your app or the USSD platform, the bundles you see are personalised for you, which makes your propensity to buy much higher.

DATA

Customer Behaviours on the platform

METHODS

As you buy it keeps teaching itself and there are thousands of different packages and combinations. The machine is then learning, based on you and your segment, and teaching itself

RESULTS

The platform seems to be working, as Vodacom's total bundles sold in SA increased 64.8% to 1.1 billion in the six months ended 30 September

COMMENTS

Gauss was really smart but I wonder if the data was actually Gaussian distributed.  He unfortunately did not generate figures that would have made this easier to check, perhaps due to not having a computer and instead doing everything by hand.
