Self developed project. Unreleased.


GOAL
Background removal with deep learning.
When given a 2D picture representation of anything the application should be able to find
the main object in the picture and cut out any background surrounding it.

DATA
The most common datasets for segmentation were the COCO dataset, which includes 
around 80K images with 90 categories, the VOC pascal dataset with 11K images and 
20 classes, and the newer ADE20K datasets.
The COCO dataset was chosen as the main source of data since it includes 
much more images with the class “person” which was our class of interest.

METHODS
The model was trained with a schedule: standard cross 
entropy loss, RMSProp optimizer with 1e-3 learning rate and small decay. The 11,000 images were
split into 70% training, 20% validation, 10% test. 
To keep to the training schedule aligned with the original paper, the epoch size was set on 500 images.
This also allowed the model to be saved periodically with every improvement in results, 

Additionally, the model was trained on only 2 classes: background and person.


RESULTS
The results show a IoU value of 84.6 on the test set, while current state of the art is 85. 
That number fluctuates throughout different datasets and classes. 

There are classes which are inherently easier to segment e.g houses, roads, where most models 
easily reach results of 90 IoU. Other more challenging classes are trees and humans, 
on which most models reach results of around 60 IoU.
