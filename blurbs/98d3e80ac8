SOURCETensor Algebra Compiler http://news.mit.edu/2017/faster-big-data-analysis-tensor-algebra-1031AGENTSoftware for Humanity (SPLASH), researchers from MIT, the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, and Adobe Research.GOALTo calculate tensor calculations at 100x speed over existing, non-optimized software packages.DATAfour-dimensional tensor data from e-commerce sites.METHODSEvery sequence of tensor operations with its own “kernel” to skip storing and reading from memory, increases performance and it aids in faster learning of tensor data.RESULTSIt enables application developers to specify very complex sparse matrix or tensor computations in a very easy and convenient high-level notation, from which the compiler automatically generates very efficient code.COMMENTSA generalized application for programmers that can save the time required to custom code the tensor calculations(for their requirement).
