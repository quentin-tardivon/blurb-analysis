GOAL

Improve Sound quality of connected speaker by applying derverberation with neural network.

DATA

22 millions of English utterances collected from Google Voice search service. Applying artificial noise and reverberation. Work on raw waveforms.

METHODS

Logistic Disjunctive Normal Networks and asynchronous stochastic gradient descent optimization.

RESULTS

Huge improvements on environment with reverb and improvement of 18% compared to the previous system.
